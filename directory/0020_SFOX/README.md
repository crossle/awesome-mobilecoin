sFOX is the full-service crypto prime dealer for institutional investors, providing the liquidity, security, and infrastructure needed to unlock the full potential of digital assets.

sFOX is the first digital asset platform to offer institutional grade MOB (MobileCoin’s cryptocurrency) access, further expanding MobileCoin’s global footprint.

sFOX enables asset managers, banks and other institutions to buy, sell, trade and custody MOB, increasing liquidity and strengthening stability. The partnership also allows MobileCoin to utilize sFOX’s platform to manage its corporate treasury, including its own holdings of MOB.

Together, sFOX and MobileCoin are consolidating liquidity for both investors and liquidity providers in MOB, positioning MOB as an even more powerful asset while keeping compliant with all KYC & AML laws.
