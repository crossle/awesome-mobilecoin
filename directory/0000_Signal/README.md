Security isn‚Äôt an optional mode ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time.

### Speak Freely

Add a new layer of expression to your conversations with encrypted stickers. You can also create and share your own sticker packs.
### Get Together with Groups
Group chats make it easy to stay connected to your family, friends, and coworkers.
### No ads. No trackers. No kidding.
There are no ads, no affiliate marketers, and no creepy tracking in Signal. So focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.
### Free for Everyone
Signal is an independent nonprofit. We're not tied to any major tech companies, and we can never be acquired by one either. Development is supported by grants and donations from people like you.

The PIN is unknown to Signal and it can not be reset if you forget it.¬†
