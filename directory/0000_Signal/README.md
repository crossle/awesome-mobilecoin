# Features:

### End-to-end Encryption
Signal can't read your messages or view your MobileCoin transactions, and no one else can either. Information about the transaction is encrypted: sender, receiver, amount transferred, and message are all unknown to Signal.

### Easy Wallet Recovery
Securely recover your wallet if you lose your phone, using only your Signal PIN and phone number. Also, securely recover your 24 word phrase if you lose it - without sharing your private keys.

### Free and Open Source
Signal is an independent nonprofit supported by donations. Learn more about Signal and how you can support them at signal.org.
