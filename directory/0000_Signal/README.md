# Send MobileCoin through Signal 

MobileCoin can be sent between any two people with a mobile phone, anywhere in the world. Our partnership with the Signal Messenger app makes MobileCoin available to more than 100 million users across the globe. 

MobileCoin payments sent through Signal are fast, encrypted, and environmentally friendly. Your money arrives on time, every time. State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption keeps your conversations secure. 

### Security isn’t optional
Signal can't read your messages or view your MobileCoin transactions, and no one else can either. Security isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Signal works. Information about the transaction is encrypted: sender, receiver, amount transferred, and message are all unknown to Signal.

### Easy Wallet Recovery
Securely recover your wallet if you lose your phone, using only your Signal PIN and phone number. Also, securely recover your 24 word phrase if you lose it - without trusting a provider with your private keys.

### Free for Everyone
Signal is an independent nonprofit. We're not tied to any major tech companies, and we can never be acquired by one either. Development is supported by grants and donations from people like you.

### **Update Signal on your phone**
MobileCoin powers the wallet in Signal's iOS and Android apps.

Enable your Signal PIN
----------------------
A Signal PIN is used to recover the wallet linked to your Signal account if you reinstall. The PIN is unknown to Signal and it can not be reset if you forget it. To activate your wallet, you must have a Signal PIN enabled in Profile > Settings > Account.

### View Transactions

Transaction details, including the payment amount and time of transaction, are part of the MobileCoin ledger and are unknown to Signal.
-   View transaction history and details in [Signal Settings](https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/360009091591) ![profile_avatar.png](https://support.signal.org/hc/article_attachments/360091706271/profile_avatar.png) > Payments.
-   Tap a transaction to see its status and message. 
-   After there are a few transactions, tap See All, to view sent and received activity separately.

### Network Fee & Coin Cleanup Fee

All fees are determined by and collected by MobileCoin, not Signal. The transaction fee is .0004 MOB. A Coin Cleanup Fee is charged when the coins in your possession can not be combined to complete a transaction. It is also known as a defrag fee.

1.  Your total funds or total coins are viewed as a record of your transactions. 
2.  If you need to send or receive a payment consisting of more than [16 inputs or outputs](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/2f90154a445c769594dfad881463a2d4a003d7d6/transaction/core/src/constants.rs) there is a coin cleanup fee.

### Change Currency Conversion

-   The currency is based on the country code of your Signal number.
-   To convert to a different currency, go to [Signal Settings](https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/360009091591) ![profile_avatar.png](https://support.signal.org/hc/article_attachments/360091706271/profile_avatar.png) > Payments > Menu > Set Currency > select the currency.
-   The currency conversion will apply for the existing balance. This does not apply to past transactions.

### Currency Conversion Freshness

-   Currency conversions are estimated prices that should be used as a guide at the time of transfer.
-   Currency conversions will fluctuate as exchange rates are changing.
-   Currency conversions are calculated using <https://fixer.io/> and <https://ftx.com/>.
