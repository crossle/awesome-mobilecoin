# Send MobileCoin through Signal 

MobileCoin can be sent between any two people with a mobile phone, anywhere in the world. Our partnership with the Signal Messenger app makes MobileCoin available to more than 100 million users across the globe. 

MobileCoin payments sent through Signal are fast, encrypted, and environmentally friendly. Your money arrives on time, every time. State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption keeps your conversations secure. 

### End-to-end Encryption
Signal can't read your messages or view your MobileCoin transactions, and no one else can either. Information about the transaction is encrypted: sender, receiver, amount transferred, and message are all unknown to Signal.

### Easy Wallet Recovery
Securely recover your wallet if you lose your phone, using only your Signal PIN and phone number. Also, securely recover your 24 word phrase if you lose it - without trusting a provider with your private keys.

### Free and Open Source
Signal is an independent nonprofit not tied to any tech company. Signal's software will always be free and open source and can never be bought out.

#### **Get the Signal App**
Make sure you have the latest Signal app on your phone.
