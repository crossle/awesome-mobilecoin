## Send and Receive
First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet. Once you are in your wallet, tap on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE. A popup will appear; tap GOT IT. Then tap COPY to copy your wallet address.

## Connect the MixSWap Exchange
Tap on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and tap SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo. Tap on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app. 

## Swap Bitcoin for MobileCoin
Open the bot and tap the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae. This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and tap EXCHANGE.
