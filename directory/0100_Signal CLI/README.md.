Auxin is a Command Line interface for Signal written in Rust. Auxin is one of many command line interfaces for Signal and along with Signal-Cli is one of the officially supported CLIs used for Forest bots. Auxin is developed by the forest team. The name Auxin is a reference to a signaling hormone in trees, because the Forest team contains a number of trans people as well as plant lovers, it just made sense.
