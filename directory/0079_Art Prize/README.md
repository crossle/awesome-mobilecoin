Hangama Amiri, *Eight Seated Women*, 2021
------------------------------------------

Hangama Amiri's pictorial quilts depict the domestic lives of women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The Afghan-Canadian artist reveals how important private spaces become when citizens lose their public rights and freedoms of expression. Such gatherings of women in mutual support reveal how private space is fundamental outside of the punishing rules and surveillance of governments that oppress their citizens.

PersonalDataMine 003, from the series Mine Your Own Business, 2020

In Personal Data Mine 003 (from the series Mine Your Own Business, 2019), Gabriella Torres Ferrer connected their mother's credit card with a screen displaying how our consumer behavior is tracked and our digital privacy is violated by corporations. The work connects a familial tenderness with the troubling practice of data mining by huge corporations towards wealth and profit.

[Black Experience isn't a Spectacle by Jesse Katabarwa](https://newartdealers.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3493a38a571991d5c278569e7&id=f33b5b5685&e=6f82567441)

Jesse Katabarwa & Venessa Appiah's "Black Experience isn't a Spectacle" encourages its audiences to engage with Afrocentric knowledge productions, rather than through the voyeuristic gaze. On this open platform, artworks are paired with curated libraries that allow the viewer to engage with the theoretical core of the projects. The digital library is an exploration of complex themes, such as how the fetishization of Black bodies so often removes the private dignity of individuals and how Black artists can powerfully reclaim that experience.
