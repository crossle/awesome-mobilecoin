Wordpress powers 40% of the world's websites. WooCommerce powers over 28% of all online stores. MobileCoin Payments Plugin enables WooCommerce stores to accept MOB as a Payment Method. Come join our private beta. 

When you use WooCommerce as your website's e-commerce engine, our plugin (MobileCoin Payments) will enable you to add a new MOB Payment Method to use within WooCommerce. When a customer selects the MobileCoin Payment Method, they will be redirected to a MobileCoin Self-Hosted Payments Page where they can pay in MOB. When the payment goes through, the clients will be redirected back to your website's Confirmation Page.

## How to get your MobileCoin API Keys
