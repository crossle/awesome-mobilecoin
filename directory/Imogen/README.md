Imogen is the darling of the Forest team. The first MOBot to go viral and reach 300+ users. Imogen is an art bot that generates images based on a userâ€™s prompt. She has a number of paid features including a more expedient priority queue as well as tipping and sharing of tips.

Imogen has a strong social aspect, since she does her best work when she gets to collaborate with many different people. Therefore there are a number of Imogen group chats where many people can brainstorm cool prompts and have Imogen draw them.
