## Send and Receive
First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet. Once you are in your wallet, tap on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE. A popup will appear; tap GOT IT. Then tap COPY to copy your wallet address.

## Connect the MixSWap Exchange
Tap on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and tap SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo. Tap on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app. 

## Swap Bitcoin for MobileCoin
Open the bot and tap the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae. This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and tap EXCHANGE.

Designed to be used as digital cash on your phone, our payment system is easy to use with near-instantaneous transactions that are both private and secure. Did we mention that MobileCoin is the first carbon-negative cryptocurrency?

Here’s everything you need to know to get started by purchasing MOB on your mobile device and/or desktop.

Please note that while we are using Bitcoin as an example coin to trade into MobileCoin, there are a number of different cryptocurrencies that could accomplish the same purpose. Other cryptocurrencies may have lower fees and/or shorter wait times than Bitcoin.

Please report any bugs or issues with these instructions to support@mobilecoin.com. We appreciate your feedback.

Step 1: Buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange
While there are a number of coin exchanges and thousands of cryptocurrencies, one of the easiest ways is to buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange like FTX.us or Coinbase.

To buy Bitcoin on FTX:

Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps to how to complete the ID verification process, check out FTX’s video.
At the top of the FTX page, click WALLET to deposit some Bitcoin to exchange for MOB. You can use your credit card to purchase Bitcoin directly on FTX. Click the BUY BTC WITH CREDIT CARD button, and now you have Bitcoin in your wallet. For more details, here’s an explainer video.
To buy Bitcoin on Coinbase.com:

Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps of how to set up a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin, check out Coinbase’s tutorial.
Once you have set up your account, a green button will appear to add a payment method. Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted. Once you do this, the green button will change to say BUY CRYPTO.
Step 2: Download the Mixin Messenger app onto your phone
Mixin Messenger is available on both iOS and Android. Create an account. You will need to choose a 6 digit pin and enter it four times (they really don’t want you to forget this pin).



Step 3: Transfer your Bitcoin to your Mixin Messenger wallet on your phone
First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet.



Once you are in your wallet, click on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Click on RECEIVE.



A popup will appear; click GOT IT. Then click COPY to copy your wallet address.



Now you need to go back to Coinbase. You can do this on a desktop or you can use their mobile app. If you are using the mobile app, please follow the instructions below. If using a desktop, you can find those instructions at the top of this post in the desktop section.

Login to your Coinbase app. At the bottom of the home screen you will see five icons. Click the one in the middle with the two arrows. This will open a popup where you can then choose the SEND option.



This will take you to a screen that lists the different types of cryptocurrencies that you own. Click on BTC (Bitcoin). Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to send (in USD) and choose CONTINUE.



It will ask you if you would like to access your contacts to send crypto to a friend. Choose NOT NOW. Then paste the address from your Mixin wallet into the TO field and choose PREVIEW SEND.



Make sure everything looks correct and click SEND NOW. This transaction could take 30 minutes to an hour or more to show up in your Mixin wallet.

Step 4: Swap your Bitcoin for MOB in Mixin Wallet
There are two sub steps to this last step. First, go back to your Mixin app and click on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and click SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo.



Click on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app.

Once you are inside the bot, click the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae.



This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and click EXCHANGE.



You now own MobileCoin! Please be aware that anytime you transfer cryptocurrencies, it may be a taxable event, so please consult with your tax advisor.

Step 5: Move your MOB into your MobileCoin desktop wallet
First, quit and restart your MobileCoin desktop wallet TWICE to make sure it updates and is running the latest version. In your MobileCoin desktop wallet, tap the SEND/RECEIVE tab and then tap RECEIVE MOB. Tap the button in the top right corner of the address box to turn your address into a QR code.



In Mixin Messenger on your phone, where all of your currencies are listed, tap on the MOB section. Tap SEND. It will ask if you want to send to a contact or an address. Choose ADDRESS.



On the address screen tap the PLUS sign in the top right corner to add your MobileCoin desktop wallet address. Name your wallet in the Label section. In the Address section tap the square on the right side to open the camera and then use your phone to scan the QR code on your MobileCoin desktop wallet on your computer. Once you scan the code it should populate in the address line. You may need to enter a memo on the last line to activate the Continue button. Tap CONTINUE and enter your pin.



You should then see your address listed on the Address page. Tap on the address and it will open to a screen where you can enter the amount you would like to send. Enter the amount and tap CONTINUE. Enter your pin again.



This completes your transaction! You should see your MOB show up in your MobileCoin desktop wallet momentarily. Be aware that sometimes you may need to restart your desktop wallet for the transaction to appear.

Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps of how to set up a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin, check out Coinbase’s tutorial.
Once you have set up your account, a green button will appear to add a payment method. Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted. Once you do this, the green button will change to say BUY CRYPTO.
Step 2:  Install the Fennec crypto wallet on your browser
You now need a wallet to hold your crypto. You can obtain a wallet by adding the Fennec desktop wallet extension to Chrome supported browsers and Firefox.


After you add the extension, follow the instructions to set up an account. Make sure to backup the keystore to your computer when prompted or you could lose your crypto assets permanently. You also want to make sure you choose a strong password. Note: Passwords can’t be reset, so you need to make sure you remember your password.

Step 3: Send Bitcoin to your Fennec wallet
Now go over to your Fennec wallet (click the orange fox icon in your extensions bar to pop out your wallet). On the home screen you will see buttons for Send, Receive, and Swap. Below that you will see a box with tabs for Assets and Activities. Use the search bar in this box to search for BTC and click ADD ASSET.



Once you have added Bitcoin as an asset you can go back and hit the RECEIVE button. Make sure the bar is showing BTC. You should see an address that looks like a QR code with a long string of letters and numbers and a small button to copy the address in the bottom right corner. That’s your wallet address. Copy it.


Go back to Coinbase in your browser. Click the big button in the upper right corner that says SEND/RECEIVE. Make sure the SEND tab is active. At the bottom of the popup choose Bitcoin for the type of coin. Enter the amount you would like to send to your wallet. Choose a very small amount for your first transaction to make sure that you are doing everything correctly. Paste the address that you copied from your Fennec wallet into the TO field. Hit CONTINUE.

The transfer of Bitcoin into your Fennec wallet may take some time (could take up to an hour). When confirmed, you should see in your Fennec wallet that you have Bitcoin.



Step 4: Swap your Bitcoin for MOB at 4swap
You can do the first part of this step while you’re waiting for your Bitcoin to arrive into your Fennec wallet. 4swap.org is a decentralized exchange that currently lists MOB. Go to 4swap.org and click the big pink button that says USE 4SWAP.



Click CONNECT WALLET (another pink button).  Since you have already installed the Fennec wallet on your browser, 4swap should ask you automatically if you want to connect your Fennec wallet to 4swap. Click CONNECT FENNEC.



Once you have Bitcoin in your wallet and your wallet is connected to a decentralized exchange that trades in MOB (4swap), this last bit should be easy. Make sure the top line on 4swap says BTC (Bitcoin). Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to swap. Make sure the second line says MOB (MobileCoin). Once you enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to swap, the MOB line should auto-populate with the correct exchange amount and the SWAP button should activate and become pink. Hit SWAP.



After a few seconds your MOB should appear in your Fennec wallet. Congrats! You now own MobileCoin!

Be aware that exchanging cryptocurrencies may be a taxable event. Please consult your tax adviser if you have questions.

 

Step 5: Move your MOB into your MobileCoin desktop wallet
This is a really easy process. But first you have to download your MobileCoin desktop wallet and create an account. Once you’ve got your MobileCoin desktop wallet installed, it’s simply a process of sending and receiving money, which you’ve done before.

Open your Fennec desktop wallet and choose SEND.



Choose ADDRESS.

.

Make sure the top line says MOB and choose SELECT FROM ADDRESS.

 



 

Here you will need to add your MOB wallet address. Click the + to add a new address. Open your MobileCoin desktop wallet and enter your password to unlock your wallet. Once your wallet is open, you will see your address (it is the square filled with lots of blue, white, and green letters and numbers). Click on the address block to copy it.



Back in your Fennec wallet, paste your address into the address box on the bottom. Name your address something memorable. Click SAVE. Fennec will make your re-enter your password. After you do, you will see a green button pop up that says SAVED SUCCESSFULLY.



Click on the address box. This will open the send screen. Click into the box that says MOB and enter the amount you want to send.



Hit the big orange button that says SEND. You should see another green button pop up that says SEND SUCCESSFULLY! Your MOB should appear in your MobileCoin wallet within a few seconds. If you don’t see it appear automatically, log out and log back in to your wallet.
