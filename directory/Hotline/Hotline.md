The MOBot Hotline is a platform for creating Signal Messenger mailing lists. This allows you to distribute information, and announcements to many different contacts without needing them to be in a group together. Currently the Hotline sees mostly internal use, but will be rolled out to general users in the future. 

To use the MOBot hotline simply message it with the code for the hotline you want to join. You can use the code “mobilecoinfamily” to join MOBot’s hotline.
