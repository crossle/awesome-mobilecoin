The one that started it all Contactbot is the first Forest bot ever written. It allows users to purchase phone numbers for SMS forwarding. Unlike 10 minute phone number like services, you get to keep your phone number for as long as you need it. The most useful thing to do with this phone number is use it to register a signal account, either to hide your main phone number or to make a separate signal account for work or a bot.

To purchase a number simply message the bot “/order”. You don’t get to choose your phone number but you get to choose an area code and get a phone number for that area code where available. Currently only US phone numbers are available. Phone numbers are currently going for 0.0987475MOB / month.
