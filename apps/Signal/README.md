# Why use Signal?
Explore below to see why Signal is a simple, powerful, and secure messenger

# Share Without Insecurity
State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Signal Protocol) keeps your conversations secure. We can't read your messages or listen to your calls, and no one else can either. Privacy isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time.

# Say Anything
Share text, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs and files for free. Signal uses your phone's data connection so you can avoid SMS and MMS fees.

# Speak Freely
Make crystal-clear voice and video calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.

# Make Privacy Stick
Add a new layer of expression to your conversations with encrypted stickers. You can also create and share your own sticker packs.

# Get Together with Groups
Group chats make it easy to stay connected to your family, friends, and coworkers.

# No ads. No trackers. No kidding.
There are no ads, no affiliate marketers, and no creepy tracking in Signal. So focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.

# Free for Everyone
Signal is an independent nonprofit. We're not tied to any major tech companies, and we can never be acquired by one either. Development is supported by grants and donations from people like you.
